# Overview
<br>
This project starts with my personal need as a Frontend software engineer to go back to the basics and laying the groundwork.
<br>

I name it `fe-soon`, 'Frontend soon' because I wished to have this knowledge before when I started studying for changing my career to web development.
<br>

I wish anyone who is making tiny steps to become a Frontend developer or those who already are in the field, get back to the basics, and prepare once more for the next step.
