# Overview
<br>
This project starts with my personal need as a Frontend software engineer to go back to the basics and laying the groundwork.
<br>

I name it `fe-kiddo`, '_Frontend kiddo_' because I wished to have this knowledge when I was a programming 'kiddo' struggling for changing my career into the web development field.
<br>

I wish anyone who is making tiny steps to become a Frontend developer or those who already are in the field, get back to the basics, and prepare once more to become a 'grown-up' developer.

Wish you the best!
