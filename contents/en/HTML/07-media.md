With HTML5 comes the ability to embed `audio` and `video` into our HTML. We can do this using the `audio tag` and `video tag`. You can read more about the audio tag [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio), and the video tag [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video).

A bit of an older tool that you will see sometimes is an `<iframe></iframe>` tag. The `iframe tag` is used to embed another document (HTML page) within the current page. You can read more about it [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe). For more on how they are (or are mostly not) used today, check out [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3721929/when-should-i-use-html-frames) _Stack Overflow_ question.

Although you will rarely be creating your own `iframe` tags, it is very common to embed content from other websites on your page through an `iframe` tag. You can read how to embed an audio player from Spotify [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/widgets/guides/adding-a-widget/) and a YouTube video [here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters#Manual_IFrame_Embeds).
