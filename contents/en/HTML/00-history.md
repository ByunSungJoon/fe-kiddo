# Brief history of HTML : Hyper Text Markup Language
<br>

## The prototype
**Tim Berners-Lee**, a physicist and _the inventor of HTML_, used to work in the computer section of the [CERN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN) (European Laboratory for Particle Physics) at Geneva, Switzerland.

</p>

In 1980, approximately 10,000 people were working at CERN with different hardware, software. Tim proposed and prototyped [ENQUIRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENQUIRE), a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents.

## HTML: versions & evolution
Tim has an idea of creating something which would enable physicists to share research information, not only in CERN, **but from anywhere in the world**, and he came with **`HTML`** which can contain `links` of many documents from one document.

The `first version of HTML` was written by _Tim Berners-Lee_ in `1993`. Since then, there have been many different versions of HTML. Now days, we're enjoying the  [`HTML5`](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5).


* `HTML 1.0` was released in 1993 with the intention of sharing information which can be readable and accessible via web browsers. But not much of the developers were involved in creating websites. So the language was also not growing.
<br>

* `HTML 2.0`, published in 1995; which contains all the features of HTML 1.0 along with that few additional features; which remained as the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until January 1997 and refined various core features of HTML.
<br>

* `HTML 3.0`, where Dave Raggett who introduced a fresh paper or draft on HTML. It included improved new features of HTML, giving more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing web pages. But these powerful features of new HTML slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.
<br>

* `HTML 4.01` which is widely used and was a successful version of HTML before HTML 5.0, which is currently released and used worldwide. 
<br>

* `HTML 5` can be said for as an extended version of HTML 4.01 which was published in the year 2012.

## XHTML
![Example of XHTML](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50701501/93671676-07e09b00-fae0-11ea-9ba3-208072734dad.jpg)

Another version is **`XHTML`**, was a rewrite of HTML 4.01 using XML 1.0. `XML` is a standard markup language that is used to create other markup languages. Hundreds of XML languages are in use today, including GML (Geography Markup Language), MathML, MusicML, and RSS (Really Simple Syndication). Since each of these languages was written in a common language (XML), their content can easily be shared across applications.
